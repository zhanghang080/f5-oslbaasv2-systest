      # 4. Create 2 non-share networks: test-net-a, test-net-b
      # 5. Test 1: 
      #       1. Create LB in test-net-a
      #       2. Create pool

      #       4. Create member with test-net-b
      #       5. Verify LB, pool, 2 members exist on bigip.
      #       6. Delete 2 members, pool, LB.
